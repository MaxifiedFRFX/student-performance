the first 2 rows in "dummy-testing-data-1.csv" not including the labels (headers or whatever you want to call them) are full of mostly invalid data 
with some valid data sprinkled in. The next 3-5 rows are completely correct rows and exist to make sure that we can test for "false positives" don't 
occur (correct rows are deleted)

"dummy-testing-data-2.csv", on the other hand, All the following rows are correct with the exception that one piece of data is wrong in each row. Such that 
we can ensure that we can find invalid data for each label when testing our cleaner.
basically:
row 6 has one piece of invalid data in school,
row 7 has one piece of invalid data in sex,
row 8 has one piece of invalid data in age,
and so on
.

a single completely valid row exists at the end exists to test for false positives.
